What Is Static Analysis?
Static security analysis is one of the many code review tools that can be implemented without actually executing, or running, the software. Static analysis tools look at applications in a non-runtime environment. This method of testing has distinct advantages in that it can evaluate both web and non-web applications and, through advanced modeling, can detect flaws in the software’s inputs and outputs that cannot be seen through dynamic web scanning alone, including cross-site scripting and SQL insertion. In the past, this technique required source code, which is not only unpractical, as source code often is unavailable, but also insufficient. The Veracode static analysis service assesses binary code (also called “compiled” or “byte” code) instead of source code, which enables enterprises to test software more effectively and comprehensively, providing greater security for the organization.
