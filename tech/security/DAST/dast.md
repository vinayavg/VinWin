Dynamic application security testing (DAST) technologies are designed to detect conditions indicative of a security vulnerability in an application in its running state. Most DAST solutions test only the exposed HTTP and HTML interfaces of Web-enabled applications; however, some solutions are designed specifically for non-Web protocol and data malformation (for example, remote procedure call, Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] and so on).

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a process of testing an application or software product in an operating state. This kind of testing is helpful for industry-standard compliance and general security protections for evolving projects.

DAST involves operational testing, SAST involves looking at the source code and theorizing about security vulnerabilities or spotting design and construction flaws with potential for vulnerability. Moreover, DAST may be called "behavioral testing" in that testers often find problems that are not specifically linked to a code module, but happened during use. The task then is to trace them back to their roots in terms of the software design.

Tech companies offer both DAST and SAST services. Typically, these cover different types of ground in comprehensive testing processes â€” for example, DAST may only cover certain parts of the interface or design. Using DAST and SAST in combination can help catch different types of security problems before a product is released or develops a growing user base.
