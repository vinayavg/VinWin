Build integration
With the help of the Git plugin Jenkins can easily pull source code from any Git repository that the Jenkins build node can access.

The GitHub plugin extends upon that integration further by providing improved bi-directional integration with GitHub. Allowing you to set up a Service Hook which will hit your Jenkins instance every time a change is pushed to GitHub.

The GitHub Authentication Plugin provides a means of using GitHub for authentication and authorization to secure Jenkins. GitHub Enterprise is also supported.
