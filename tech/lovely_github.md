Have conversations next to your code You don’t have to switch tools to review code, share input on projects, or open up the conversation to the rest of your team.

Discover and reuse code Search across projects and issues to find, reuse, and ship code faster. Improve it along the way, and everyone wins.

Write better code On GitHub, lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.

Find and fix issues faster Greater visibility into your organization’s code helps you squash bugs before they make it to production. And with integrated issue tracking, you can keep your team on top of fixes.

Start with an issue Create an issue to suggest a new idea or track a bug. Then organize and assign tasks to your team. And don’t spare any attachments—issues support most image and file types.

Link issues and pull requests Track updates to your project without complicating your workflow by crosslinking between issues and pull requests anywhere in your GitHub organization. If you associate an issue with a pull request, it will automatically close when the pull request is merged.

See your work take shape with Projects Visualize all of your work and prioritize it right alongside your code with projects boards. See what tasks are planned or in-progress, either in a repository or across your organization.

Host GitHub where you need it Get the same GitHub experience whether you’re hosting in the cloud, on your servers, or on Amazon Web Services, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
